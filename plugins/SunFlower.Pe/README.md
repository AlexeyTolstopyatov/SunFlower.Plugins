Modern Microsoft Windows NT applications Format. Information about this
segmentation format you can find everywhere, *so more features for analysis
will be added over time*.

### CLR Metadata 

Common Language runtime information exists by
the Virtual Address of `COM Descriptor` data directory.

You can find it in one of PE sections, 
comparing VA of #15 (COM descriptor) directory 
with all sections.

If the required Virtual address
is suddenly located inside one of the sections, it is sufficient
to translate it to an raw offset from the beginning of the file.

File Offset points you to the Start of `IMAGE_COR20_HEADER` 

| Name          | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| CLR Header    | [x]    |
| `#Strings`    | []     |
| `#Blob`       | []     |

### Visual Basic 5/6 data structures

Now we are talking strictly about Visual Basic 5.0 and 6.0 versions.

**First thing**, you **must** to know is next:
"Visual Basic (Classic)" modules/objects
**never had** `#15 data directory` (COM Descriptor table).

They are notable for the fact that the imported modules always
contain MSVBVMxx.dll (insert 50 or 60 here) first of all.
(that is, literally 1 item in the import table).

ActiveX controls that are not written in C/++, but use a VB VM,
must export the following list of functions:

| Name                | Ordinal | Address  |
|---------------------|---------|----------|
| DllCanUnloadNow     | @1      | 2FF46858 |
| DllGetClassObject   | @2      | 2FF46858 |
| DllRegisterServer   | @3      | 2FF46858 |
| DllUnregisterServer | @4      | 2FF46858 |

**BUT** this things uses **only** Visual Basic 5.0/6.0 objects.

> [!INFO]
> Tested Virtual Machine is Oracle VirtualBox machine with Microsoft Windows 2000 (NT 5.0) with installed SDK (Visual Basic 6.0 CCE,), WinDbg, Visual Embedded 6.0.

**Second thing** is a pointer to main `VB_HEADER` structure
follows by the `AddressOfEntryPoint`. Following by this pointer
you find next /translated to x86 Assembly/:

```asm
push *address*      ; Offset to the VB_HEADER
call ThunRtMain     ; Thunder Runtime procedure
```

**Third thing** is a validation of `VB_HEADER`
Signature field must be `VB5!` (not Null-Terminated String)
Interpreter must be `MSVBVM50` or `MSVBVM60`.

| Name                   | Status |

| COM designer info      | []     |
